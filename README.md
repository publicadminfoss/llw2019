# FSFE Legal and Licensing Workshop 2019 - Workshop on Public Administration Free Software Policies

This workshop follows up on the Public Administration workshop from LLW18 with the ultimate aim to set up a LN Special Interest Group on Public Administration (PA) Policies. We will look back at what public administrations have done so far to adopt policies related to free software and plan ahead for what can be done to foster the adoption of free software by public administration going forward. The workshop will present and discuss current findings about government policies on free software acquisition and production, current legal documentation and identify priorities. We will review the leading the policies, examine the similarities and talk about common and best practices. We will also talk about the gaps between industry best practices around FOSS and the government practices and what lessons Governments still have to learn to match the sophistication of private industry.
